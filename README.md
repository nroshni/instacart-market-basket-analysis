Exploratory data analysis &amp; pattern identification in the transactional data provided by Instacart

This dataset is provided as a part of [Kaggle - Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).
The blog on Instacart's opensourced data can be found [here](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2)

This anonymized dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.
For each user, between 4 and 100 of their orders are provided, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. The week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders is also provided.

The idea is to predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. So here is as exploratory analysis to find patterns in the dataset and also predict which items would be reordered by the user.
